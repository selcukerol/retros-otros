Coding BootCamp Assignment: Agency Week.

Prompt:

You have been hired by an entrepreneur to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for him to present to potential investors. You will be placed into a small group of your classmates to serve as the dev team at your agency working on this project.

To begin Agency Week, you will pitch your project idea to an Angel Investor (your instructor). Once approved, you will have a week to build out an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the investor, and present the project to a panel of staff and instructors.

During the week, a staff member will serve as the Product Manager, and have regular check-ins with you to make sure the project is on track for the investor. These check-ins will cover progress in the following areas:

-User Experience
-Product Road Map
-Future Features
-Overall Design
-Code Quality (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby)
