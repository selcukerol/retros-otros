    <h2>WHO ARE WE ?</h2>
    <p>We thought you might like to know a bit more of what we're all about. Retros-Otros launched in New York City back in 1875 as a local classified ads and community platform, designed to connect people who were either planning to sell, or buy second hand items.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've grown a lot since then through word of mouth and we're proud to say that Retros-Otros is now loved by its ever growing community. We are the second hand store that now spans 5 boroughs across New York City. Our aim at Retros-Otros is to give you a simple and easy-to-use tool that lets you quickly find the second hand items you are looking for.

    <h2>OUR MISSION:</h2>
    <p>
      Second-hand stuff leaves you more open to whatever your own personal style is rather than feeling dictated to by shops.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission of Retros Otros is to promote consumption of second hand goods to conserve Earths' natural resources which all life depends on.

      Our vision is a world where the diversity of life thrives, and people act to conserve nature for its own sake and its ability to fulfill our needs and enrich our lives.</p>

      <p>How do we achieve this mission and vision?</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Through the dedicated efforts of our diverse staff, including more than 600 scientists, all of whom impact conservation in 69 countries.</li>
        <li>With the help of our many partners, from individuals and governments to local nonprofits and corporations.</li>
        <li>By using a non-confrontational, collaborative approach and staying true to our five unique core values.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Thatâ€™s how Retro Otros has done more than anyone else to advance conservation around the world since our founding in 1875.</p>
